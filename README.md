# Healthcare-Billing-Data-Pipeline


**ðŸ“Œ Introduction**
The Healthcare Billing Data Pipeline is designed to streamline the ingestion, transformation, and analysis of hospital claims, transactions, and patient billing data. The goal of this project is to provide a structured data pipeline for efficient revenue cycle management (RCM), helping hospitals track claims, payments, denials, and key financial metrics.

This project leverages:

Azure Data Lake (ADLS) for raw data storage
Databricks & PySpark for data processing
SQL databases for structured analytics

##  Overview of the Dataset

**Data Sources**
The data pipeline ingests data from multiple sources, including:
âœ… Hospital EMR Data â€“ Patient encounters, provider details, and billing transactions.
âœ… Payor Claim Files â€“ Insurance claim approvals, denials, and reimbursements.
âœ… ICD-10 API Data â€“ Standardized classification of diseases for billing.

**Data Coverage & Structure**
Covers multiple hospitals (Hospital A & Hospital B).
Organized into Landing â†’ Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold layers using Medallion Architecture.
Data is stored in Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) in Parquet format and processed into SQL tables.

**Data Processing in Databricks**
Convert raw data into structured, validated, and analytics-ready format.

âœ… Bronze Layer â†’ Converts raw CSV/JSON into Parquet format.
âœ… Silver Layer â†’ Standardizes patient, claims, and transactions data.
âœ… Gold Layer â†’ Aggregates data for KPI tracking & analytics.
